# Weather API

## Project Description
For this project, I set out to develop a user-friendly weather application that enables users to input a city name and get real-time information about the temperature and weather conditions. Rather than investing my time in CSS design, I opted for a simple interface and devoted my attention to implementing the necessary post and get requests utilizing the open weather API.

While I'm still relatively new to working with APIs, leveraging Postman significantly helped me grasp the concept and functionality of APIs. Despite facing some challenges working with res.write and res.send, I successfully overcame them with the aid of the documentation.

Moving forward, I plan to apply the skills and knowledge gained from this project to develop more API projects. For instance, I'm considering creating a MailChimp sign-up. Additionally, this project has undoubtedly contributed to my journey towards becoming a skilled full stack developer.

## What is an API?
APIs are an essential mechanism that facilitates communication between two software components by using a specific set of protocols and definitions. For instance, suppose you want to know the daily weather updates. In that case, the weather application on your mobile device communicates with the weather bureau's software system through APIs to access the daily weather data and provide you with real-time weather information on your phone.
